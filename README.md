Project Title
# danoneHackathon

Technologies
I used React JS + Vite, React Router Dom, PrimeReact, PrimeFlex, Contentful and Graphql

Setup
Download or clone the repository
run npm install
run npm run dev

Approach
In this project I was presented with several adversities, however I made a great effort since I did not know cms technology or requests through Graphql.
It's definitely not my best work, but the lessons in a developer's career don't end and you have to adapt, I always try that.
